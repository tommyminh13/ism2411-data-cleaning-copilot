# Reflection

## What Copilot generated
GitHub Copilot helped me write parts of my data_cleaning.py script. I used comments to tell Copilot what the function should do, and it suggested code for functions like `load_data()` and `clean_column_names()`.

## What I modified
I edited the code that Copilot suggested. For example, I changed variable names, added error handling, and added extra cleaning steps that the assignment required. I made sure the code matched the exact steps I needed for the project.

## What I learned
I learned how to clean data in Python using pandas, like fixing column names, removing spaces, handling missing values, and removing invalid rows. I also learned that Copilot is helpful for getting started, but I still need to understand the code and make changes myself.
